## Now built with React!

### React Files

Can be viewed on the react-dev branch of this repo: https://github.com/jcpsimmons/jcpsimmons.github.io/tree/react-dev

### How it was built

Rebuilt a previous HTML/CSS/JS site using React. Routing handled with BrowserRouter, Switch and Link. 

In order to deploy on GitHub I used react-snapshot to create static HTML pages from the live React site.
