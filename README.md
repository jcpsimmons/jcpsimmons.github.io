### react-port

This branch is a WIP where I am porting the existing site to react. Mainly this is to facilitate easier updates to my portfolio page. Right now I'm copying about 50 lines of HTML every time I want to add an additional project. Through use of a map function in a React component, I can now add additional project by just adding their information in an array of objects. More information on this in the README.md in the react-port branch (click the dropdown above to switch over).
