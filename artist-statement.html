            <h4>Authentic environmentalism</h4>
            <p>
            A reduction of visual and aural clutter creates a clean environment that inspires the audience to maintain mindfulness of their environment, to be unobtrusive in nature. Faux-environmentalism leverages the “green trend” to virtue signal. The true purpose of faux-environmentalism is to gain recognition as a Good Person™. A multimedia piece about humans affecting climate change can only motivate through guilt, which leaves the audience feeling guilty and unclean. Authentic environmentalism focuses on a positive-focused bottom-up approach where features such as respect of natural form are communicated in a way that influences the audience to make small and sustainable changes.
            </p>

            <h4>Countercultural</h4>
            <p>
            I reject many facets of contemporary culture. Works I have created on the topic of government spying, psychedelic drugs, and religion encourage audiences to reconsider their stance on cultural issues. These topics are often presented in ways that are shocking or offensive in order to disrupt routine thought processes. As an artist I have always operated somewhere in between the academic and commercial worlds. This outsider dynamic has allowed me to question base assumptions about aesthetics and craft in each of these domains.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Recursive</h4>
            <p>
            Well crafted code, architecture, music, and even consumer products are self-similar on many levels of resolution. I strive for a high degree of recursion of principles in my artistic work. Craftsmen such as Schoenberg have gone too far in this regard by creating technical exercises instead of works of art. Contemporary culture has pivoted in the opposite direction by prizing raw expressionism over a thoughtful economy of materials. My work aims to employ recursion of principles in a way that retains aesthetic sensibility.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Functionalist</h4>
            <p>
            Art serves a purpose in culture. Humans can go only go a few days without water. They can go longer without food. They can go even longer without art, but the effect of doing so is a kind of spiritual starvation. Art allows people to reconnect with the stories we tell ourselves. Art that is aesthetic but lacks a deeper meaning is similar to junk food; it sustains the organism but provides essentially no nutritional value. I acknowledge the functional necessity of art in human life and attempt to provide nourishment through my works by allowing them to propagate from a deeper sense of meaning, a story we tell ourselves.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Human-centered</h4>
            <p>
            My art isn’t crafted to be put in a glass box on display in an austere museum setting. It is to be interacted with by people. In the weeks following every major performance, I make a point to share meals with various audience members to get a better sense of how they perceived the work. This information allows me to tune the next work to be more idiomatic for the audience.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Prank</h4>
            <p>
            I enjoy building intricate houses of cards and then toppling them just before the last card is placed.
