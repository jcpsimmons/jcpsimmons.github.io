The internationally performed works of multimedia artist Simsies are an immersive experience for audience members and performers. Simsies aims to engage all of the senses through use of digital multimedia, believing that it is an unnatural phenomenon to hear sound divorced from spectacle. Through employing aural and visual semiotics, Simsies plays on the expectations and emotions that the audience has assigned to various well known symbols. His multimedia works have been featured at the 2016 GLAS Animation Festival in Berkeley, the Joint ICMC - SMC 2014 Conference in Athens, and at ACMC 2014 in Melbourne. His music has been read by members of the Toledo Symphony Orchestra, and he was commissioned to create animations for the entirety of Olivier Messiaen’s two hour, piano tour de force, Vingt regards sur l’enfant-Jésus.
