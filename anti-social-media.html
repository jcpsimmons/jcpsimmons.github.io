            <h4>Attention Span</h4>
            <p>We are living in the “attention economy”. Attention is a finite resource. Spreading it thinly over 1000s of social media posts is <a class="link" href="https://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask.aspx">inefficient</a>, and leaves less time for more meaningful pursuits.</p>

            <h4>Better Things To Do</h4>
            <p>Easy things are usually not worthwhile things. Sometimes easy things can become worthwhile when you share the experience with another person in real life. If I have a free hour in the evening, I think it is better spent going on a long walk through town than catching up on what a bunch of people I kind-of-digitally-know have been up to.</p>

            <h4>Mental Health</h4>
            <p>Social media gives us continuous rapid hits of <a class="link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9858756">dopamine</a>. Compromising your brain’s dopamine system turns you into an addict. The only reason we as a society don’t call social media addicts addicts, is because the negative consequences are usually invisible to others, unlike many external consequences of a drug or alcohol addiction. <span class="orangeText"><b>Rates of anxiety and depression have skyrocketed in the past decade but it is rarely discussed in the news</b></span>. This rise in anxiety and depression coincides with the rate of social media user adoption. Social media is proven to cause increased instances of <a class="link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197116300343">anxiety and depression</a></p>

            <h4>Highlight Reel</h4>
            <p>You are probably not as happy as you look in all of your Instagram photos. Your muscles aren’t as big as they look with the perfect lighting angle, and sharpening filter. You didn’t spiritually “find yourself, #blessed” in India because you were busy captioning photos the whole time. I am humble enough to admit that even as I shrug these photos off, somewhere in my animal brain, I feel more inferior than I did before I saw them. I’m not trying to shelter myself from the accomplishments of others, it’s sometimes good to feel a bit inferior, it lets you know where you’ve slacked off, but I want to compete with humans, not propagandists.</p>

            <h4>Enhanced Social Life</h4>
            <p>I’ve probably let some friends drift away. After this difficult transitional period I started to have deepening friendships and family relationships with people. I have a few friends on the East coast that are busy. Our schedules don’t line up. We either suck it up and find time for a phone call, or we write long, in-depth emails back and forth when we have time for a response. In my area, I make much more of an effort to see friends. I put my phone away when we sit down to a meal together. We make eye contact.
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m invited to less events, and this is an improvement - I'm only invited to the most meaningful ones now. This has the added benefit of eliminating any kind of decision fatigue I may have previously faced when presented with three potential events to choose from on the same night. Overall I think that people are doing too much. There are too many events. If the event isn’t good enough to invite someone to during a conversation, maybe it's best to just not occupy time with it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Despite the fact that I’m doing <a class="link" href="https://us.braun.com/en-us/world-of-braun/less-but-better">less</a>, and spending less time “socializing” (if you are to consider social media a form of socializing), I feel <span class="orangeText"><b>better</b></span> linked to the people that are important to me.</p>

            <h4>More Thoughtful Entertainment</h4>
            <p>A tweet is just enough characters to convey one simple idea. You can write one while grunting it out on the toilet and it will post to the web in milliseconds. It’s a low-effort, low-resolution medium for conveying information. You are what you eat. Consuming Tweets as entertainment will begin to turn you into a simpleton. Despite the anti-intellectual bend in mainstream America, truthful knowledge exists, and it’s good to acquire more of it. What would you be like in 5 years if you spent all of your social media browsing time reading great books instead?</p>

            <h4>Ethical Data Sharing</h4>
            <p>Social media information gathering is <span class="orangeText"><b>creepy</b></span>. It’s the only word for it. If you were living in the late 1990s, and a corporate-type stranger came up to you, telling you that you could have access to faster email, and all you had to do was share the contents of all of your email exchanges with him, you’d hopefully tell that guy to fuck off. I don’t know all of the workers at Facebook, or Google. I don’t know what they might do with my “private” exchanges on Facebook Messenger - have a laugh over some drama I’ve been through with a coworker? Maybe try to <a class="link" href="https://cambridgeanalytica.org/">influence how I vote</a>?</p>
